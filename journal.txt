- I decided to go with the Seattle Airbnb dataset initially because I thought that if I had issues, I might find better
support on Udacity

- Then I read up on what CRISP-DM actually is and why its important. To some extent, I can understand the need to for
standardizing this process

- I then decided to pick a simple question and find the answer to it using the CRISP-DM cycle. The question is:
What do the room availabilities in Seattle look like on Airbnb?
